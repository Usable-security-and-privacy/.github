Topic: Measuring and improving the efficacy of google mail banner while considering the social engineering attacks
Mail banners can be very effective to stop many social engineering attacks, phishing, data breaches and it also protects us from suspicious mail that is received from an unknown source. Email virus consists of malicious code distributed in email messages to infect one or more devices. This malicious code can be activated in numerous ways when the email recipient clicks on an infected link within the message, opens an infected attachment, or interacts with the message in some other way. In phishing attacks, phishers use social engineering techniques to redirect users to malicious websites after receiving an email and following an embedded link Alternatively, attackers could exploit other mediums to execute their attacks such as Voice over IP (VoIP), Short Message Service (SMS) and, Instant Messaging (IM). Phishers have also turned from sending mass-email messages, which target unspecified victims, into more selective phishing by sending their emails to specific victims, a technique called ‚Äúspear-phishing.‚Äù Basically, Google mail banners came into action in these types of scenarios to alert recipients to avoid visiting those suspicious attachments by filtering the received mails in situations where the mail address had been already marked as spam, not in contact with the receiver, or from an unknown source with an attachment.


We were very curious to find out each individual's behavior towards the mail banners. For this, we will be asking them questions about how they react when they receive a mail with banners from a source, and also try to find how this is dependent on various factors like age, gender, and other demographic variables. We wanted to notice how this behavior changes for the different users acting on the mail with banners and does it affect their trust in these services anyhow.
